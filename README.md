I hold a <b>Diploma in Web Development and Design</b> from the Ara institute of Canterbury.
<br>
Currently, I am studying a <b>Bachelor of Information and Communication Technologies</b> at Ara, specializing in Software Development.
<br>
<br>
Outside of class, I am learning full stack development through <b>The Odin Project</b>.
<br>
<br>
My main objective is to create websites which are not only responsive, regardless of the device used to view them, but also accessible.
