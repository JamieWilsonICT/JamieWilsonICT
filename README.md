Hello! I'm Jamie, a web developer passionate about crafting user-friendly digital experiences. I focus on creating accessible and efficient interfaces, and I enjoy the problem-solving aspects of web development. My journey in this field began with a Diploma in Web Development & Design from the Ara Institute of Canterbury, which I completed in 2021. Currently, I'm furthering my skills through a Bachelor's Degree in Software Development.
